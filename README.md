# TitleTool
Visual Studio Extension for moving a toolbar called "TitleBar" to the main window titlebar.

**To use:** create a custom toolbar named "TitleBar" (no quotes), this toolbar will be rendered in the title window if enabled.

This extension does not currently have any settings.

## Why?
I find toolbars just clutter my UI and the titlebar has a lot of "wasted" space, so why not put some frequently used functionality there?

## Features
* Renders a toolbar called "TitleBar" in the main window title bar
* Supports full screen switching (remains visible in Full Screen mode)
* Can be disabled by disabling the toolbar "TitleBar" as you would disable any toolbar (Tools > Customize)

## Supported versions of Visual Studio

This extension has currently only been tested on **Visual Studio 2022 17.4**.

The .vsix restricts usage in older versions so it is not currently known if it will work there. If you find it does report back to me and I will update this readme.

## Changelog
